# QPath4MS FHIR Implementation Guide

### Looking for the readable FHIR Implementation Guide?

Please visit [FHIR Implementation Guide](https://helict.github.io/qpath-fhir-resources/output/)

To interprete/compile FHIR Shorthand (FSH) files use [SUSHI](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi) command line tool (reverse conversion
with [GoFSH](https://github.com/FHIR/GoFSH)). To generate the complete QPath4MS FHIR IG run `_updatePublisher.sh` (optionally) and
`_genonce.sh` script on the repository. Later we can migrate to https://build.fhir.org using the 
[Auto IG Builder](https://github.com/FHIR/auto-ig-builder).
